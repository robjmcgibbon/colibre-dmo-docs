Simulations
===========

Directory layout and naming conventions
---------------------------------------

All simulations are kept at ``/cosma8/data/dp004/colibre/Runs``. The simulations are divided into subdirectories based on their box size and mass resolution with names of the form ``LXXX_mY``. The value of ``XXX`` corresponds to the simulation box side length in comoving Mpc, and the value of ``Y`` is the mass resolution. For example, the directory ``L100_m6`` contains all simulations run in a :math:`100\rm{Mpc}^3` box at :math:`m_{gas} \approx 10^6 \rm{M_\odot}` resolution. Within each simulation directory there are subdirectories for the available data products.

.. note::
   The ``LXXX_mY`` box size/resolution names (e.g. ``L100_m6``) and the standardised
   AGN feedback run names (e.g. ``THERMAL_AGN_m6``, ``HYBRID_AGN_m6``)
   are softlinks rather than the real directory names. The box
   size/resolution softlinks point to directories named after the particle
   count, e.g. ``L100_m6 -> L0100N1504``. The AGN feedback run softlinks point
   to directories whose names can vary between box sizes and resolutions,
   since the ``Hybrid`` name in particular encodes the current calibration
   parameters, e.g. ``HYBRID_AGN_m6 -> Hybrid_non_equilibrium_dVplus0p5dex``.

Dark matter only simulations
----------------------------

For each hydrodynamical simulation, there is a corresponding DMO simulation that uses the same initial phases and the same total number of particles.
To create the initial conditions for the DMO simulation, baryonic particles from the corresponding hydrodynamic run were converted into CDM particles.
