Snapshot directory layout
=========================

On COSMA the run directory for each simulation is located at
``/cosma8/data/dp004/colibre/Runs/<run name>``.

The layout of the snapshot files for each simulation is shown in the
diagram below. The ``snapshots`` directory is output by SWIFT, with one
``colibre_XXXX`` subdirectory for each output time, where ``XXXX`` is
the snapshot number.
See :doc:`snapshot_redshifts` for the relation
between snapshot number and redshift.
The ``SOAP-HBT`` directory contains particle membership
information (what subhalo each particle is bound to).

.. tip:: The easiest way to access particle data is to use :doc:`swiftsimio
         <../tools/swiftsimio>` to read the :ref:`virtual-snapshot`
         so that you don't need to concatenate data from multiple
         files and unit metadata is read automatically.

.. _virtual-snapshot:

Virtual snapshot file
---------------------

The ``SOAP-HBT`` directories contains "virtual" snapshot files which have
names of the form ``colibre_with_soap_membership_XXXX.hdf5``. 
These files contains HDF5
virtual datasets which refer to particle data distributed over a
number of additional HDF5 files. This file can
be treated as a single, large snapshot file which contains all of the
particle properties.

Each snapshot directory (``snapshots/colibre_XXXX``) also contains a virtual 
snapshot file named ``colibre_XXXX.hdf5``. This 
should only be used if the ``colibre_with_soap_membership_XXXX.hdf5`` file
is missing, since it does not contain subhalo membership information.

Snapshot data files
-------------------

The virtual snapshot file does not contain any particle data itself.
Instead, the data for each snapshot is split across two
sets of HDF5 files: the SWIFT output
and subhalo membership information. Within these sets, the files follow
naming conventions such as ``colibre_XXXX.Y.hdf5``, where ``XXXX`` is
the snapshot number and ``Y`` numbers the files that make up the snapshot.
Each one of these files contains the properties of particles for part of
the simulation volume. To read the complete data for a snapshot, it is necessary
to read from all of the files in the corresponding set.

.. warning:: The virtual snapshot file
   ``colibre_with_soap_membership_XXXX.hdf5`` does **not** contain any
   particle data itself. If you download a virtual snapshot you
   **must** also download all of its data files:

   - every SWIFT chunk file in ``snapshots/colibre_XXXX/``, and
   - every membership chunk file in ``SOAP-HBT/membership_XXXX/``.

   The virtual file refers to these chunk files by their **relative
   path**, so you must keep the ``snapshots`` and ``SOAP-HBT``
   directories in their original relative layout. The safest approach
   is to download each directory in full and unpack them under a common
   parent directory.

.. warning:: If HDF5 can't find the data for a virtual dataset, it
   silently returns incorrect "fill" values! So if you download a
   virtual snapshot and get strange results, it may be that HDF5 isn't
   finding the real data files.
