HBT-HERONS merger trees
=======================

.. note::
  To track the evolution of a galaxy (i.e. the main progenitor branch) then the full HBT-HERONS merger trees are not required.
  Each subhalo is assigned a unique ``TrackId`` which remains consistent across all snapshots,
  and this allows the quick retrieval of the main progenitor of a given subhalo.
  For example, the main progenitor of a :math:`z = 0` subhalo with ``TrackId = 10`` corresponds to the subhalo whose ``TrackId = 10`` at earlier times.
  ``TrackId`` is stored in the SOAP catalogues as ``data.input_halos_hbtplus.track_id``.
  The fields ``data.soap.progenitor_index`` and ``data.soap.descendant_index`` can also be used to track individual objects.
  Note that, due to SOAP not storing the information for subhaloes with :math:`N_{bound} < 20` (e.g. disrupted, merged or poorly resolved),
  some ``TrackId`` values will be missing from the SOAP catalogues. 
  In practice, this means there could be an object with ``TrackId = 11`` in the :math:`z = 2` catalogue,
  but no object with ``TrackId = 11`` in the :math:`z = 0` catalogue.

Full merger trees are provided in the form of HBT-HERONS
`(Forouhar Moreno et al. 2025) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.543.1339F>`__
outputs. A more detailed description of the quantities, and additional examples,
can be found on the
`HBT-HERONS website. <https://hbt-herons.strw.leidenuniv.nl/>`__
The source code is available `on github
<https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/HBT-HERONS>`__, and the exact git revision which
was used to generate a subhalo catalogue can be found by inspecting the
``git_hash`` attribute of the ``Header`` group in the HDF5 output file.

The catalogues are sorted by ``TrackId``. This makes file reads for single objects fast, since the index location of a subhalo is known beforehand, as it is simply its ``TrackId``. The following properties are available for each subhalo:

In order to get access to :doc:`all the halo/galaxy properties calculated by SOAP<soap_property_table>`, the two catalogues can be linked using the ``TrackId`` field, as shown in the example below.

.. _warning_hbt_m200:

.. warning:: Since the HBT-HERONS definition of spherical overdensity is based on the 
             enclosed mass of bound particles only, it does not follow the common convention in the 
             literature, which includes the mass contribution of all particles. The values
             in the SOAP catalogues should be used instead.
